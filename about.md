PACTUM PARTNERS was founded with the vision of building an innovative advisory practice and with the understanding that family offices benefit from a partner dedicated to fostering inter-family collaboration through a trusted network of sophisticated families united by shared missions, visions, and values. 



Knowing that family offices struggled with reviewing deal flow, due to time and staffing constraints, our initial focus was on attending to their needs with regards to direct investments. However, we soon found that the opportunity for cross-collaboration presented itself beyond the tradition realm of capital allocation.

​

Family Offices interested in growing their peer group attend industry related dinners, conferences, and/or begin memberships. The experience can be frustrating as the attention is placed on topics such as education or best practices. 

​

We offer an alternative, our discreet services carefully tailored to the individual needs of your family.
