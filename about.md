PACTUM PARTNERS was founded with the vision of building an innovative advisory practice and with the understanding that family offices benefit from a partner dedicated to fostering inter-family collaboration through a trusted network of sophisticated families united by shared missions, visions, and values. 



Knowing that family offices struggled with reviewing deal flow, due to time and staffing constraints, our initial focus was on attending to their needs with regards to direct investments. However, we soon found that the opportunity for cross-collaboration presented itself beyond the tradition realm of capital allocation.


We offer an alternative, our discreet services carefully tailored to the individual needs of your family.
