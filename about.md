PACTUM PARTNERS was founded with the understanding that sophisticated family offices, aligned through shared missions, visioms, and values, benefit from a partner dedicated to fostering peer collaboration. 



With the vision of building an innovative practice, knowing that family offices struggled with reviewing deal flow, due to time and staffing constraints, our initial focus was on attending to their needs with regards to direct investments. We soon found that the opportunity for cross-collaboration presented itself beyond the tradition realm of capital allocation.


We offer an alternative to traditional family office networks by tailoring our introductory services to the unique requirements of your family.
