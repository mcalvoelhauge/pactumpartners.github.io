# WHY PARTNER WITH OTHER FAMILY OFFICES?

The ideal long-term partner for your family office is another family office. This is due to the peer relationship which encourages mutual respect, direct and open communication, and an alignment of mission, vision, and values. 

Uniquely capable of leveraging their significant shared expertise, capital, and influence, inter-family office partnerships provide an attractive alternative to traditional fund managers by operating with greater control and flexibility without facing limited time horizons, high fees, and regulatory restrictions.
