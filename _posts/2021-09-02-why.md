# WHY PARTNER WITH OTHER FAMILY OFFICES?
<div style="text-align: justify">
The best long-term partner for your family office is another family office. A relationship among peers encourages trust, mutual respect, and direct and open communication. Through an alignment of mission, vision, and values these partnerships are often able to transcend generations.  

Uniquely capable of leveraging their significant shared expertise, capital, and influence, inter-family office partnerships provide an attractive alternative to traditional fund managers by operating with greater control and flexibility without facing limiting time horizons, high fees, and regulatory restrictions.
