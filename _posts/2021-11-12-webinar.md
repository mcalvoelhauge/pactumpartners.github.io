# OPPORTUNITY MANAGEMENT IN COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT
## December 10, 2021 
*(10:00 AM - 11:15 AM EST)*


The Orso Family and Korman Family will share insights into their family offices real estate direct investments, based on experience and objectivity. 

The discussion will take us through developing and growing innovative real estate investment strategies with a long-term perspective that embodies the vision and legacy of the family for future generations. In addition, we will review their models for direct investments into real estate and the critical steps necessary to accomplish the intended results in the immediate and long-term.

Anthony Orso is the patriarch of the Orso Family and serves as Newmark's president of Capital Markets Strategies. The office is focused on high growth real estate developments. The co-founder and former CEO of Cantor Commercial Real Estate (CCRE), Cantor Fitzgerald's fully integrated commercial and multifamily real estate finance company, where he financed over $256 Billion in Real Estate. In 2014, CCRE was ranked as the No. 1 Fastest Growing Company by Crain's New York Business. That same year, Mr. Orso was named No. 1 in Commercial Observer's 50 Most Important People in Commercial Real Estate Finance.

The Korman family has been investing in real estate since the 1890's. For over 5 generations, they have constantly adapted to meet the challenges and opportunities of the times. Following a succession event, they revised the transactional 3-5 year “Institutional model” that did not allow for the maximization of the family investments. The Korman's realized that they should look to partner with families who appreciate the value of a strong financial plan and patience. Innovation in a 100 year-old family enterprise? Conflict resolution? Succession? 

This webinar is open to Family Offices, Family Businesses, and Family Enterprises. Advisors will be accepted on a case by case basis.
