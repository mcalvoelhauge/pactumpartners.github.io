## Korman Family Office 
### James Korman

At the end of the 19th century, Hyman Korman worked for the family business that built workforce housing for the railroad under contract to Czar Nicholas II in Russia. At that time Russia needed to build railroad infrastructure in order to increase trade with The Austro-Hungarian Empire. The Korman firm was building housing for the workers laying the train tracks for two such projects; one originating from Odessa and the other from Brest, simultaneously. The housing was built from logs that could be disassembled and reassembled (in one day) as rail construction progressed westward. 

In 1904 because of the general discord in Russia, including the impending Russo-Japanese war, Hyman Korman was directed by his father, Bejnamin Korman, to relocate to America. He arrived in Philadelphia and initially took a position in the manufacturing company, followed shortly by his future bride who had family that had previously settled on farms outside the city of Philadelphia. After a series of promotions in the manufacturing business, Hyman purchased a farm in Northeast Philadelphia. Hyman continued to commute to his Center City manufacturing position and his wife Yetta took charge of the children and the farm. During the warm summer months, she took in guests desiring to escape the heat of the city. Other members of Mrs. Korman’s family also provided lodging and livery services for horses from their own farms for travelers to and from Philadelphia and the countryside.

In 2017, the Korman family celebrated its 100-year anniversary in business in the United States.

As a charter member of Drexel University’s Real Estate Management and Development Board, James has been helping shape curriculum for tomorrow’s industry leaders. James has been a guest lecturer for the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and has been referred to as an industry visionary for his lifestyle initiatives designed to convert the enormous pool of home buyers into renters by choice. His vision extended well beyond his competitors and captured a previously untapped larger market. These innovations coupled with John Korman’s timely recapitalizations and refinancing s resulted in over $500 million in realized value.

James Korman served as President of the Apartment Association of Philadelphia as well as President of the Pennsylvania Apartment Association where he created the Renter’s Bill of Rights, which was presented to Legislators in the State Capital. As a highly ranked tennis player James graduated from the University of Delaware where he captained the men’s tennis team. Sports have been the platform in which James became accustomed to competing and winning. His love of sports led him to charitable endeavors with professional sports organizations like the Philadelphia Eagles and Philadelphia Union Soccer team where James is the Chairman of the Nominating Committee and The Grants Committee. He utilizes the influence of professional athletes’ celebrity status to help positively impact underserved children.
